2022-07-08: To change where csv files save and load from, change the value of script_dir everwhere it occurs
		(Todo: consolidate constants such as script_dir so they can be changed in one place)

m * y / I

m - moment
y - ybar stupid thing
I - moment of inertia (goes by I)


Stress at each station:
	- Take moment from Length vs Moment
	- Convert length to stations using station thickness
	- Depth = max(abs(z_out)) -> into eqn for Flexural Stress.ipynb -> y_bar_bottom
	- I and y_bar_top calculated from points in Flexural Stress

tau = v*Q / I*t

Shear:
	- We hate Q
	- Calculate Q and I at any point in the station
	- Basically similar process to above
